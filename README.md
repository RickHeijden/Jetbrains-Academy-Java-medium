### Goal

The goal for this project is to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI. The game should be able to be played by 2 AIs,
an AI and a human, or 2 humans. If a human is playing the game than the game is played by giving coordinates and after
each turn the field is updated and printed. After the game is done, that is there is either a winner or there are no
more moves, the program prints the state, i.e., either the winner or draw. The AIs make their moves automatically and do
not need any further assistants. Furthermore, there are 3 different levels of the AI, which are easy, medium and hard.
